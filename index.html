        <h2></h2>
        <p><h3>The 100 is a series of young adult science fiction novels by Kass Morgan. The first book in the series,
           The 100, was published on September 3, 2013, by Little, Brown Books for Young Readers. Day 21, its sequel, was released on September 25, 2014,
           and Homecoming was released on February 26, 2015. A fourth novel, Rebellion, was released on December 6, 2016
           Ninety-seven years after a devastating nuclear apocalypse wipes out almost all life on Earth, 
           thousands of people now live in a space station orbiting Earth, which they call the Ark. Three generations have been born in space,
           but when life-support systems on the Ark begin to fail, one hundred juvenile detainees are sent to Earth in a last attempt to determine whether it is habitable,
           or at least save resources for the remaining residents of the Ark. They discover that some survived the apocalypse: the Grounders,
           who live in clans locked in a power struggle; the Reapers, another group of grounders who have been turned into cannibals by the Mountain Men; and the Mountain Men, who live in Mount Weather, 
           descended from those who locked themselves away before the apocalypse. Under the leadership of Bellamy and Clarke, the juveniles attempt to survive the harsh surface conditions,
           battle hostile grounders and establish communication with the Ark. </h3></p>
